## 1. Information We Collect

LevelUp – ELP Trainer does **not** require user registration and does not collect personally identifiable information directly.

However, the app integrates with third-party services that may automatically collect limited, non-personal data for functionality, analytics, and purchases:

* **Google AdMob** – for displaying advertisements.
  AdMob may use anonymized identifiers (such as advertising IDs) to provide relevant ads and measure performance.
* **RevenueCat** – for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  RevenueCat processes data provided by the app stores (such as purchase tokens) to verify and manage your purchases.

Refer to their respective privacy policies for details:

* [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

* All training progress, preferences, and usage settings are stored **locally on your device**.
* We do not transmit or store personal data on our own servers.
* The app’s backend (hosted via Render) handles only automated content generation (e.g., ATIS or radio messages) and does not collect user data.

## 3. In-App Purchases

* In-app purchases and subscriptions are handled securely through the **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**.
* We do not access or store your payment information.
* Purchases include optional upgrades such as “Remove Ads” and “Pro Features.”
